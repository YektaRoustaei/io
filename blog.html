                    <h3>How This Software Engineer Turns Data Into Technical Decisions</h3>
                    <p>In a world where engineering choices have to be precise, data-driven, and scalable, this backend-focused software engineer in the UK shows how to blend hands-on delivery with a research mindset. At Ambue Group—an Innovate UK project for sustainable home improvements—they sync records for 100k+ dwellings, pipe ML outputs into a Next.js interface, and guide interface logic so recommendations reflect live model predictions.</p>
                    <p>Their earlier work at Douran Group paired React accessibility improvements with resilient Laravel services. That full-stack balance continued at Leicester University, where they built a Laravel job-recommendation system powered by a React API and SQL database, complete with robust unit tests and agile cadences.</p>
                    <p>Their analytical streak means product debates rarely rely on gut instinct alone. They run Python-based analysis (Pandas, scikit-learn) to explore engagement data, tighten hypotheses, and highlight the metrics that should guide API or workflow changes.</p>
                    <p>They also keep sharing knowledge. As a volunteer lecturer at Ada National College for Digital Skills, they translate complex programming concepts for learners aged 14–21. That habit of documenting, testing, and communicating carries back into the day job, where it keeps teams aligned while they ship APIs, tune databases, and connect research workflows to UX implementations. If your team needs someone who can move from infrastructure to insight without dropping the thread, their track record at Ambue and beyond proves they can lead the stack end-to-end.</p>

                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>I’m a software engineer who likes turning complex ideas into simple, usable interfaces.</p>
                    <p>My favorite tools are React, Next.js, and TypeScript.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy designing component systems, collaborating with product teams, and improving performance in small, practical steps.</p>
                    <p>When I’m not coding, I explore photography or experiment with design ideas.</p>
