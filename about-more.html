            <h1>Frontend developer at the intersection of UI, data, and performance.</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Yekta — a frontend developer who loves clean UIs and smart systems.</p>
            <p>I build web applications with React, Next.js, and Vue, and I enjoy turning complex ideas into friendly, reliable interfaces. Lately I’ve also been working with AI and ML pipelines, bringing intelligent features into real products.</p>
            <p>Based in Manchester, UK, I’m happiest when I’m shipping features, collaborating with kind people, and learning something new.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m a frontend-focused software developer with over 5 years of experience across web applications, APIs, and AI-enabled workflows. I’ve worked in startups and product teams where you have to move fast, keep things maintainable, and always think about the user experience.</p>
                <p>At the moment, I split my energy between two things I love:</p>
                <ul class="focus-list">
                    <li>Building smooth, testable frontend applications with frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue.</li>
                    <li>Designing AI/ML workflows that make products smarter instead of just more complicated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I enjoy joining projects early, helping to shape the architecture, and then staying close to the details: tests, accessibility, performance, and the “tiny” UX decisions that make an interface feel kind and intuitive.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me exploring design ideas, reading about AI, or wandering around the city with a camera and a coffee.</p>
                <h3>Values I bring to every studio</h3>
                <ul class="values-list">
                    <li>• Empathy-led research that keeps community at the center.</li>
                    <li>• Systems thinking: scalable components, shared documentation.</li>
                    <li>• Obsessive polishing of micro-interactions and typography.</li>
                    <li>• Clear communication and async-friendly collaboration.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>I joined Ambue as a Junior Frontend Developer, working on a brand-new Next.js application and learning the product, codebase, and service design approach. Over time I took on more ownership of core features and became Frontend Lead, guiding implementation and helping the team ship quickly without losing quality.</p>
                    <p>Some highlights:</p>
                    <ul class="detail-list">
                        <li>Built a Next.js app from 0 to production, reaching 90%+ test coverage.</li>
                        <li>Designed and implemented reusable TypeScript UI components documented in Storybook.</li>
                        <li>Integrated live REST data streams, improving load times by around 30%.</li>

                        <li>Supported CI/CD pipelines and collaborated with product, design, and backend teams.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>On the AI side, I’ve contributed to an Innovate UK–funded project building an LLM-driven tool for housing retrofit recommendations and cost estimation. I designed and automated ML workflows on Google Cloud Platform, including training and batch prediction using Python, scikit-learn, Cloud SQL, and Vertex AI pipelines.</p>
