            <h1>Senior frontend engineer focused on predictable delivery.</h1>
            <p>I own React/Next.js architecture, data contracts, and testing strategy for products that can’t afford regressions.</p>
            <p>My day-to-day is TypeScript builds, API integrations, and performance audits backed by real metrics.</p>
            <p>Based in 🇬🇧 United Kingdom, I’m usually pairing with engineers, reviewing PRs, or automating another check into CI.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’ve led frontend efforts in small teams where a single release can impact thousands of users. I design the architecture, implement core flows, and set the guardrails that keep velocity high.</p>
                <p>Expect thorough code reviews, measurable targets, and documentation that makes handoffs painless.</p>
                <h3>How I operate</h3>
                <ul class="values-list">
                    <li>• Direct user feedback loops tied to analytics dashboards.</li>
                    <li>• Shared component libraries with versioning and upgrade paths.</li>
                    <li>• Non-negotiable accessibility and performance budgets.</li>
                    <li>• Async updates with clear owners and next steps.</li>
